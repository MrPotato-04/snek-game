### Worst snake game ever made
<p>
  This is a snake game made as a apprenticeship for bit academy.
  Its not verry optimized but it works and looks ok.
  
  Saddly the original project is currently offline (indefinitely)
  The original also icluded saved highscores and a login system (the source code is still available in the Old branch)
</p>

### New (scaled down) live version: <a href='https://mrpotato-04.github.io/snek-game/'>Link</a>
